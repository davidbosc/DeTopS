 Description : This program will:
                    -Optionally discretize input data, from multiple files
                    -Develop set descriptions for each input set
                    -Perform the descriptive intersection power set for the set of input files (CPU or GPU)
                    -Calculate a measure of the closeness of the sets intersected
                    -Output the results of the intersections to a text file

 that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of
 its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work
 or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain
 the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions
 your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create
 Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
 conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License
 is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" or "fair
 dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of
 the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You
 may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date
 You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any
 licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision
 shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original
  Work with other software or hardware.

 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License
 may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in
 which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction
 excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention

 means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
 whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
 shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned
  by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

 16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright Â© 2005 Lawrence Rosen.
 Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification.
 Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to
 Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate
 your modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original works of authorship
 subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License
 is the "Open Software License" or "OSL" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified
 License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice
 "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly
 similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open
 source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and
 You comply with its license review and certification process.

 17) Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License ("OSL 3.0")
 is "Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0". The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:

 (a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue
 whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support
 or services relating thereto.

 (b) The first sentence of Section 7 ["Warranty of Provenance"] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken. For
 Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.

 (c) In the first sentence of Section 8 ["Limitation of Liability"] of this Non-Profit OSL 3.0,
 the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes "direct" damages.

 (d) The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this "Non-Profit Open Software
 License" rather than the "Open Software License". You may distribute or communicate the Original
 Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the
 representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or
 communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall
 publish clear licensing notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize
 You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under
 the original OSL 3.0 license.

 (e) Original Works licensed under this license shall reference "Non-Profit OSL 3.0"
 in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0 license.
